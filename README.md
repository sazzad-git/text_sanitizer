# Text Sanitizer Pro - Chrome Extension

A professional Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that sanitizes text by replacing restricted words with safe alternatives. Designed to help users communicate safely on platforms with strict keyword policies.

## Features

- **🛡️ Text Sanitization**: Automatically replaces restricted words (e.g., "payment" -> "pa_yment", "email" -> "ema_il").
- **✨ Smart Case Preservation**: Maintains the original capitalization of words (e.g., "Payment" -> "Pa_yment").
- **👋 Custom Greetings**: Add a professional greeting and closing with significant one-click ease.
- **📋 One-Click Copy**: Instantly copy the sanitized text to your clipboard.
- **⚙️ Custom Word Management**: Add, view, and delete your own restricted words and replacements.
- **🌗 Dark/Light Mode**: Automatically adapts to your system's color scheme.
- **🔄 Sync**: Your custom words are synced across all your Chrome devices.

## Installation

### For Users (Development Mode)

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Enable **"Developer mode"** (toggle in the top right corner).
4.  Click **"Load unpacked"**.
5.  Select the folder containing the extension files (the root of this project).

### For Developers

1.  Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server (auto-reloads on change):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will launch a new Chromium instance with the extension loaded.

Build Instructions

To create a production-ready ZIP file for the Chrome Web Store:

1.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  This creates a `dist` folder containing a `.zip` file (e.g., `text_sanitizer_pro-1.1.0.zip`).
3.  Upload this ZIP file to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.

> **Note:** The build process uses `web-ext` to package the extension. It automatically ignores `node_modules` and other development files to keep the package size small.

## Usage

1.  Click the **Text Sanitizer Pro** icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2.  Paste your text into the **"Input Text"** area.
3.  Click **"Sanitize"** to process the text.
4.  (Optional) Click **"Custom"** (👋) to wrap your text with a standard greeting and closing.
5.  Click **"Copy"** to copy the result to your clipboard.

## Customization

You can add your own words in the **Settings** tab:

1.  Enter the word to block (e.g., "urgent").
2.  Enter the safe replacement (e.g., "urg_ent").
3.  Click **"Add Word"**.
